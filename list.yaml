2. Managing Roles and Permissions:

    - Direct User-Permission Associations: Allow users to be directly associated with permissions in addition to roles. 
                                           This way, you can assign specific permissions to individual users without creating new roles.
    
    - Role-Based and Direct Permissions: Use roles to manage common sets of permissions but provide the ability to grant additional individual permissions directly to users.
    
    - Permission Groups: Group related permissions together and assign these groups to roles or users to simplify management.
